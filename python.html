                        <h3>Description:</h3>
                        <ul>In this project, I aimed to build a predictive model that estimates the mileage per gallon (MPG) of automobiles based on various input variables. The dataset used contained information on 400+ cars, including attributes such as cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin, and car name. </ul>
                        <h3>Process:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Imported necessary libraries including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.</li>
                            <li>Loaded the dataset from an Excel file and performed initial data exploration.</li>
                            <li>Checked for missing values and performed data cleaning procedures such as type conversion and missing value imputation.</li>
                            <li>Employed boxplot visualization to identify outliers, particularly in the acceleration column, and implemented a custom function to remove them.</li>
                            <li>Explored data distributions, identifying patterns and anomalies.</li>
                            <li>Investigated correlations between variables using heatmap visualization.</li>
                            <li>Handled categorical variables using one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical format.</li>
                            <li>Selected significant features using SelectKBest based on F-regression scores.</li>
                            <li>Split the data into training and testing sets.</li>
                            <li>Constructed a linear regression model using scikit-learn.</li>
                            <li>Evaluated the model's performance on the test set, achieving an accuracy (adjusted R-squared value) of 0.86.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                        <ul>The developed model demonstrates strong predictive capability in estimating automobile mileage based on input features. By leveraging linear regression and robust data preprocessing techniques, I have built a reliable tool for forecasting MPG, which can be invaluable for various automotive applications, including fuel efficiency analysis.</ul>

                    <div class="inner">
                        <h3>Description:</h3>
                        <ul>In this machine learning project, the goal was to predict whether a bank customer would invest money or not, making it a classification problem. Logistic regression was used as the primary model, and other algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, naive Bayes, random forest, and support vector machines (SVM) were also explored.</ul>
                        <h3>Process:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The project started by importing the dataset from an Excel file, which contained over 41k rows and 20+ variables. Initial data exploration involved checking for missing values and performing data cleaning tasks such as outlier treatment and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.</li>
<li>Visualizations such as boxplots and histograms were used to understand the distribution of variables and identify any patterns or anomalies in the data.</li>
<li>The final dataset was created by combining only numeric columns, and significant features were selected using SelectKBest based on F-regression scores.</li>
<li>The data was split into training and test sets with a 70-30 split. Logistic regression was used to build the primary model, achieving an accuracy of 0.94 with an F1-score of 0.65.</li>
<li>The performance of the model was evaluated on the test set, and comparisons were made with other algorithms including KNN, naive Bayes, decision trees, random forest, and SVM.</li></ul>
                        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                        <ul>The logistic regression model demonstrated strong predictive performance in determining whether a bank customer would invest money or not. Key drivers such as age, consumer price index, and education were identified as significant features in predicting investment decisions.</ul>
